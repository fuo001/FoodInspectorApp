        <h2>How to use the Application</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            Upon accessing the website/application, the user will 
            be greeted by the homepage.  On the homepage the 
            user will see a map on the right and category 
            filters on the left.  The user has the option to 
            choose to use their current location in order 
            to better include restaurants around them.  From 
            there, the user can choose the specific category 
            of food they are searching for as well as the 
            mile radius around them.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            After the user makes these decisions, they will 
            then click submit and a list of food options 
            will appear on the page in relation to their 
            filters.  The user will see a chart with seven 
            columns worth of information to help them make 
            their choice.  These columns include: the name 
            of the restaurant, the address, the category 
            of food, the location, and their compliance 
            for hand washing, sewage disposal, and 
            rodents/insects.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The user can repeat this process as many times 
            as they would like by simply returning to the 
            category section and filtering what they are 
            looking for. They may also access the About 
            page to learn about who we are, and there is a 
            Documentation page for users to view information 
            such as this.

        <h2>Why this Application?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            The idea of this application is to make it as simple as possible for a user to make dining decisions.  In a few simple clicks and swipes, the user can easily make a decision on a clean place to eat and then details associated with that establishment.  The simplicity of it is what we hope will keep users coming back to the platform.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The purpose of this application is to reduce the number of options for a user.  The idea is to diminish the information overload for decision-making situations.  The application returns a list of health-code compliant restaurants which contribute to the user’s food preferences.  The stakeholders associated with this application are the general public, food-distribution companies, restaurants, restaurant managers, and people who care about whether the food people are eating is healthy.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>What does it solve?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            Our proposed system would solve the information problem because it displays a list of eight to twelve restaurants per page that comply with food safety regulations.  The applications affords consumer confidence in decision-making situations by both reducing and condensing the amount of information related to the information problem.  We will use the Health API.  This dataset contains information about food inspections in Prince George’s County.  We chose the dataset because some people value a clean eating environment, and we did not know of any app with information about a restaurant’s cleanliness and food. We also hoped that this would bring people peace of mind because sometimes applications can have too much information and make it hard to make decisions.  We hope that we have solved that issue.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Why is this application different from the others?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            Most food applications lack information about a food establishment’s health inspection records, overall cleanliness, and user-submitted food ratings. We hope to merge the food inspection data of food establishments in Prince George’s County with the overall data of food establishment in Prince George’s County from Yelp.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>What issues did we run into?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            We ran into issues with aggregate values.  These kinds of values may misrepresent the truth behind the data.  Using visualizations presents much more information in a single object than a bunch of objects with both aggregated and multi-dimensional data. The comparison of two aggregated multi-dimensional numbers is like comparing fruits. Both objects are fruits and they might both be apples, but one might be a tart granny-smith while the other is a sweet Fuji apple.  The characteristics of both apples vary as much as the variables of two aggregated numbers.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>How did we overcome these issues?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            With this being said, we ultimately left out aggregate metrics (# of Stars according to Google or Yelp, total number of passed tests) out of the final design. Additionally, the information was presented at the overview level, followed by a presentation of details for that selection.  The overview level minimizes information overload, giving the user a moment of clarity before using the application. The moment of clarity affords the ability to plan their actions before interacting with the application. The applications affords discovery of options as well as a reduction in information overload.  Once the user makes their initial selection, they should be more comfortable with the next step that reveals more information associated with their selection.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Who can use this application?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            The application will be available to any person without accessibility constraints. Future iterations of the application should use area elements so that screen-readers detect the elements on the page, providing accessibility-friendly descriptions for each web page element. 
            This application solves the problem of having a complete list of health-code compliant restaurants in a visual design that helps make it easy for users to make decisions quickly and efficiently.  We want the user to be confident and happy with their decisions so that they can enjoy their meals as well as return to the application in the future for more options in the future.
