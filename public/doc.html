        <br>
        <p>
            Upon accessing the website/application, the user will 
            be greeted by the homepage.  On the homepage the 
            user will see a map on the right and category 
            filters on the left.  The user has the option to 
            choose to use their current location in order 
            to better include restaurants around them.  From 
            there, the user can choose the specific category 
            of food they are searching for as well as the 
            mile radius around them.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            After the user makes these decisions, they will 
            then click submit and a list of food options 
            will appear on the page in relation to their 
            filters.  The user will see a chart with seven 
            columns worth of information to help them make 
            their choice.  These columns include: the name 
            of the restaurant, the address, the category 
            of food, the location, and their compliance 
            for hand washing, sewage disposal, and 
            rodents/insects.
