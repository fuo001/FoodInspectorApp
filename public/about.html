        <h2>How to use the Application</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            The problem that this application tackles is the  lack of information available to the public on a food establishment’s compliance with health and safety regulations. The goal is to present the inhabitants of Prince George’s County  with good and clean places to eat. These inhabitants are the key stakeholders, but anyone living in Maryland or passing through the area can seek to benefit from the application. Our solution to the information problem was to provide users with a visual representation of good places to eat based on their standards and the establishments compliance with the terms of our dataset.

            The Prince George’s County Health has provided us with a dataset that covers investigations into the county’s food service facilities. It is a hearty dataset with 31,994 unique entries and consists of 29 columns that can be divided into the following categories: Establishment Description, Inspection Details, Address, Food Safety, Proper Holding Temperature, Safe Cooking Temperature, Safe Food Handling, and Facility Hygiene.  This dataset was chosen because of its comprehensive overview and how it relates to the prominent audience of PG County inhabitants, whom of which we are targeting.

            The Food Inspection Registry Application is targeted to be used across Android, iOS, and online browsers.  We want this application to be available to as many users as possible in as many ways as possible.  As of right now, the application is available through online browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Opera), but the long term goal is for there to be apps on the App Store and Google Play Store for this application.
